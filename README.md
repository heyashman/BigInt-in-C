# BigInt-in-C
## Description

The BigInt Library is a C++ library that provides a comprehensive implementation for handling large integers beyond the standard data type limits. This library supports various arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and advanced functions such as calculating Fibonacci numbers, Catalan numbers, and factorials of large integers.

## Features

### Arithmetic Operations: 
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, and Power functions for large integers.
### Comparison Operations: 
Standard comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
### Increment/Decrement: 
Pre and Post increment/decrement operators.
### Advanced Functions:
```
Calculation of Fibonacci numbers
Calculation of Catalan numbers
Calculation of Factorials
Square root of large integers
```
### Stream Support: 
Input and output stream operators for easy I/O operations.
### Exception Handling: 
Throws exceptions for arithmetic errors like division by zero and underflow.
